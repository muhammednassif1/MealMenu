# MealMenu  Application 
I divided the project into 4 CLASSES

1.catagory.dart:This code defines a Category class that represents a category with an ID, name, image URL, and description. It provides a constructor to create new categories and a factory method to easily create them from JSON data.

2.main_catagory_screen.dart:this code effectively fetches categories from an API, displays them in a user-friendly grid layout, and allows navigation to a detailed screen for each category.

3.main_list_screen.dart:this code allows users to view meals within a specific category fetched from an API and displayed in a user-friendly grid layout.

4.main.dart:his code sets up the basic structure for your Flutter application and launches the MainCategoryScreen as the starting point for users to interact with your app.
